# AI-pong

this is a game of pong made in python, this program has a special AI trained using the Neat algorithm.


Using the run_neat() function you can train your own AI with different requirements, these requirements can be chaged in the "config.txt".

In config.txt the pop_size can be changed to 100 to improve the AI.

Using the test_ai() function you can play with the AI.
